The approach for doing this test in framework choice is Angular, the reasons are various but the one I consider the best is the flexebility and speed of coding that can be achieve by using this framework.
The amount taken to made this development it took about 7-8 hours
The main difficulty for this challenge was the way to handle JWT tokens without using a httpOnly cookie, so it needs a little bit more of creativity to do it this way, the choice made was to use localstorage as store for the token and a flag to know wheater the user is logged in or not.
Among others difficulties but with lesser importance was not having the control over the api and being forced to work under the models provided by the api, other than that I didnt found any other problems.
